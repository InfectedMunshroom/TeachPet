This is a custom Super-App Software that is to be installed and tweaked on a system running Arch Linux with the i3wm window manager.

As per the latest testings, keeping only the bare minimum resources required, a system with 1gb ram and intel centrino CPU can run and efficiently update and manipulate the data records in MySQL (Tested: 5000 records per table)

This software is designed for schools/teachers who do not have access to the latest and greatest tech but still need to maintain electronic records of their students
